# Marketing Campaign Result
Using python libraries (pandas, seaborn and matplotlib), I performed exploratory data analysis on sales and marketing functional unit campaign data of 2240 customers of ABC Limited, including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failure, and channel performance to determine:
- The most successful marketing campaign
- Top performing products
- I gave recommendation on the type of customers that should be targeted in subsequent marketing campaigns based on the preferences of existing customers
